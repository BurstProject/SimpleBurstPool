Specs:<br />
Proportional payouts(pool hopping really isn't an issue here)<br />
2% fee<br />

<br />
Usage:<br />
Paste your BURST- address into the box at the top to receive a generate address.<br />
Generate plots for that address, and use pocminer_pool to mine with them<br />
windows: java -cp pocminer_pool.jar;lib/*;lib/akka/*;lib/jetty/* pocminer_pool.POCMiner mine http://127.0.0.1:8125 http://thispoolsip<br />
linux: java -cp pocminer_pool.jar:lib/*:lib/akka/*:lib/jetty/* pocminer_pool.POCMiner mine http://127.0.0.1:8125 http://thispoolsip<br />
Local wallet does not have to be running, but if it is pocminer_pool will solo mine with plots it has passphrases for<br />
<br />
Temp bans:<br />
Due to verification of shares being computationally expensive, the pool will temp ban ips that submit bad results multiple times<br />
Bans only last 10 minutes<br />
Multiple occurances of incorrect work, or duplicate shares in a short period of time will trigger temp bans<br />
